This repo defines simple Airflow setup using Docker for local development. At least it meant to be simpler then
official Apache Airflow Docker setup.


## Setup

To build and run container run the following commands

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Next proceed to `localhost:8080` and use credentials `airflow/airflow` to login.
